# Project 1 : Game.

For my project, I have chosen to create the game of Blackjack.

## One peice at a time.

1. The first thing I did was plan out my wireframes and how my databases would look, on a whiteboard. I then wrote out the entire array of objects that my recipes would be contained in. (my own API for recipes.)

3. The next thing I did was set up all my models and basic routes, so that all my pages were accesible and nothing was broken.

4. Once my routes were set up, I included bcrypt and added User functionality and a user database. I implemented sessions with the user as well.

4. After I had accounts and sessions set up, I started building up my recipe form and adding functionality to it(such as adding multiple ingredients and/or steps.). I connected the form to my database, and then started working on where I would display the recipes.

5. It was somewhat difficult figuring out all the JSON routes to each of my data peices but I was able to do it in the end, and I had a functioning recipe maker that stored all the inputed data into my database, and then pulled it out and put it onto my page.

6. The recipe creator/displayer was the main functional peice of my app, and so after that was completed I started working on the styling. I styled almost every single page, with info, different fonts, etc. I pulled in a population counter that was live, on my front page. Set up a navbar with working links, and after that I was about done.

7. The last step was implementing authorization for certain pages based on User login.


## If I had more time

1. I would have added functionality to add images to the recipes that people create, using cloudinary.
2. I would have gotten to add a few more pages that I wanted to, for input, reviews and such.
3. Again, added a paypal function to steal money from you in some way or another. :)


## How to create a recipe:

When you visit my page, you will be on the home page where It has some info and explains what the purpose of my app is. On the navbar, if you click on the "Entomophagy" link, it will take you to a page with a menu bar on the left side of the screen. One of the links in the bar will say "Recipes".
Click here in order to be taken to the recipe creator/viewer.
Enjoy! Grub them Bugs!
